                <p>My name is Michał Szcząchor. I'm currently pursuing diploma in game development to enhance skills. I love creating games as much as I love playing them.</p>
                <p>I have created two fully functional games as game projects at Futuregames, currently working on the third one (the biggest one yet). I also participated in game jams as well as created some side projects before and during my time at Futuregames.</p>
                <p>I always enjoy learning new things, writing effective, well-organized code, work solo or with team and I'm always eager to take on new challenges. </p>

            <h1>Game Projects</h1>
            <h2>Futuregames projects</h2>
            <p>Culmination of knowledge gained throughout years of learning, Futuregames projects are team-based, weeks-long and shipped at the end of development.</p>

                        <p>This game was made during our second game project at Futuregames. As a climber, you will try to reach the peak of the mountains as fast as possible. Climb and jump among rocks, manage to get enough chalk and not to fall from the cliff.</p>
